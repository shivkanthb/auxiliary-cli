**connect**
```
aux connect wiki
```
This will prompt for a directory for your intern wiki search. In the future, I plan to integrate with api's directly.

**iw**  (internal wiki)
```
aux iw <keywords to search>
```
iw stands for internal wiki  and is used to search the document folder provided in the `connect` step.
Instead of having to grep search and then manually viewing the files, we made it super easy to search from your terminal and view the files right there.

Eg - 
```
aux iw deploy
```
![aux iw deploy](https://auxiliarytoolsassets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/iwsearch.png)
![viewing selected file](https://auxiliarytoolsassets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/iwsearchless.png)


**Help**
```
aux help
```
Displays help menu with a list of available options
